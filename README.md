# port-scanner
With the desire to have a least some projects on here, I wrote a basic port scanner in Python in the hopes of adding to it as time progresses.

Notes:
    1. Add different types of scanning depending on user needs
    2. Scanner works, but requires a few tries... work on way to make it so
       that it tries multiple times by itself until open ports are found
