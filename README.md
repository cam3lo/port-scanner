# port-scanner
A basic port scanner script written in Python to at least start having some programs up on the hub with the hopes of adding to it as time progresses.

Notes:
    1. Add different types of scanning depending on user needs
    2. Scanner works, but requires a few tries... work on way to make it so
       that it tries multiple times by itself until open port found
